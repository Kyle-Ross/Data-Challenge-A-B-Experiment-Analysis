# Data Challenge A/B Experiment Analysis
As a part of an interview challenge for an Australian tech company I was given a large A/B testing dataset. As a part of this I had to perform a Python Analysis on the data using a Jupyter Notebook. This is the end result which successfully moved me on to the next stage of the interview.

Given what I have learned since making this, I would approach the task a little differently - with more use of pre-existing tools rather than building everything from scratch. However, as it stands it was fantastic challenge and a great practice excercise for Python, Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks.
